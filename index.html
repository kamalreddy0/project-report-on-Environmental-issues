             <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Introduction <br> </h3> 
                <p style="text-align: center;">Our environment is constantly changing, and as our environment changes so does the need to become increasingly aware of the environmental issues that are causing these changes. With a massive increase in natural disasters, warming and cooling periods, and different types of weather patterns, people need to be a lot more cautious with the way they lead their lives in conjunction with the types of environmental issues our planet is facing.</p>
                <br><hr><br>
                    <h4>Environmental Issues</h4>
                    Environmental issues are the harmful effects of human activities on the environment. These include pollution, overpopulation, waste disposal, climate change, global warming, the greenhouse effect, etc. 
                    
                    Various environment protection programs are being practised at the individual, organizational and government levels with the aim of establishing a balance between man and the environment.
                    
                    Some of the current environmental issues that require urgent attention are:
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Climate Change</h4>
                    Climate change is a great concern in today’s scenario. This problem has surfaced in the last few decades. Greenhouse gases are the major cause of climate change. Environmental changes have several destructive impacts such as the melting of glaciers, change in seasons, epidemics, etc.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Global Warming</h4>
                    The burning of fossil fuels, emissions from automobiles and chlorofluorocarbons add to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has led to an increase in the earth’s temperature causing environmental changes. This increase in temperature across the globe is known as global warming.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Ozone Layer Depletion</h4>
                    The ozone layer is a layer of concentrated ozone gas. It protects us from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. This very important layer is being destroyed by CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), which are used in industries and everyday life (e.g. aerosol cans).
                    
                    The chlorine in these compounds destroys the ozone layer. The hole in the ozone layer leaves humans and wildlife exposed to harmful UV rays resulting in several skin diseases including cancer.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Water Pollution</h4>
                    The introduction of harmful substances into rivers, oceans, lakes and ponds, which changes the physical, chemical or biological condition of the water is called water pollution. The polluted water lacks oxygen and therefore the organisms die. 
                    
                    Water is the main source of life and therefore it is our prime duty to prevent it from any kind of pollution.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Air Pollution</h4>
                    Air pollution is the result of emissions from industries, automobiles, and the increasing use of fossil fuels. The gaseous emissions have added to an increase in the temperature of the earth. Not only this, but it had also increased the risk of diseases among individuals.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Solid Waste Management</h4>
                    Solid-waste management is defined as the discipline associated with the generation, storage, collection, transfer and transport, processing, and disposal of solid waste in a manner that it does not have a harmful effect on the environment. 
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Deforestation</h4>
                    Deforestation is the depletion of trees and forests at an alarming rate. The trees provide us with oxygen, and several raw materials and also maintain the temperature of the earth. Due to the depletion of trees for commercial purposes, there has been a drastic change in the earth’s climate.
                    
                    Forests are an abode to a large number of wild animals and plants. Destruction of forests has led to the elimination of a large number of plants and animal species affecting biodiversity.
                    
                    <br><br><h4>Overpopulation</h4>
                    The earth’s population is increasing drastically. It is estimated to be more than seven billion. The increasing population has led to a shortage of resources. If this continues, it will be very difficult to sustain such a huge population. The other environmental issues including pollution, waste management, deforestation, climate change and global warming are all associated with overpopulation.</p><br>

                <h3 class="a">About This Project</h3>
                <p class="a">The project that I took up is: promoting the usage of public transport, carpooling and transport
                    sharing for the judicious usage of resources and to save environment.<br><br>
                    The project deals with two environmental issues: air pollution and depletion of fossil fuels. The
                    reason behind the selection of this topic is that there are many number of people whom I
                    personally see in this rapidly growing Indian megacity: Hyderabad, who travel alone to far
                    distances, in cars. Due to the establishment of many IT companies and other offices in some
                    areas there are many people who travel to those areas. This leads to traffic congestions,
                    atmospheric pollution and heavy usage of fuel. This is a burden on the nature. This resulted in
                    exploitation of natural resources which is wrong on part of the humans.<br><br>
                    This matter, on conservation of nature and natural resources is taught to most of the children of
                    the country in schools and in communities. So did I learn about the relevance of this conservation
                    of resources for sustainable development and to maintain balance in the eco system. As a student
                    of class 8 I have learnt about the importance of this conservation of resources in one of the
                    geography chapters: resources. Also I have learnt about the relevance of conservation of fuel in
                    one of my science, chemistry lesson that is coal and petroleum. These lessons that I have learnt at
                    school helped me realize the need for the selection of this project and the importance of

                        <br>PLAN & ACTION</h3>
                    The design and the phased manner of the working of the project:
                    The project has been taken up in phases activities.

 1. Collection of data
 2. Classification of data
 3. Analysis of data
 4. Interpretation of data
 5. Creating awareness</pre><br>
                    <h4>Collection of data</h4>
                    A questionnaire was prepared to collect information from the people about matters like the
                    mode of transport, number of people travelling at the same time, distance travelled, amount spent
                    etc. These were distributed to people and they were requested to fill up the details regarding their
                    transport system. The questionnaire was distributed to various people in the neighborhood
                    community.<br><br>
                    <h4>Data classification and analysis</h4>
                    After receiving the information from the people data was classified. It was analyzed and
                    represented in the form of graphs. This survey helped me to find the present condition of the
                    transport system used by people and also the need and problems of the people in commuting.
                    After the analysis, people were grouped into the following categories:
                    1. Same origin - different destination
                    2. same origin - same destination
                    3. Different origin - same destination
                    After completion of the grouping, we approached several people who had a scope to share
                    transport and told them the purpose of the project and the need to share transport and motivated
                    them with the various benefits of sharing transport.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>ACTIVITIES DONE</h3>
                    The activities done are as follows:
                    <br><br> <h4> 1. Survey:</h4>
                    As mentioned above the first activity done was data collection through survey. This was done by
                    distributing questionnaires. The purpose of the survey was to find the present condition of the
                    transport system of the people, and the cost incurred, distances travelled etc.
                    Filling up of questionnaire<br><br>
                    <h4>2. Door to door campaign:</h4>
                    The door to door campaign was a way to approach the people personally and motivate them by
                    telling them the benefits of pooling and the need to pool. We also let them know about some
                    other people living in the same area who had a similar destination so that they would group up
                    with them and pool a car. </p>

                <p>
                   
                    The initial and the post surveys reveal that there are many people who started travelling by public
                    transport and began to car pool, if not everyday, occasionally.
                    The data tells us that about 65% of the people who travel alone, by CARS, have started to car
                    pool and also use public transport [25%-using public transport, 40%-pooling] and more than
                    87% of the people now spend roughly between Rs.100-Rs.3000 on transport per month. It is also
                    seen that 45% of the people travelling by 2-wheelers, to far away distances have now shifted to
                    public transport.

                    <h4>IMPACT OF THE PROJECT:</h4>
                    According to the people and other sources, the project had surely made impacts on the
                    society and the local environment. This project helped people save a great deal of time
                    and money spent on travelling. Also fuel was saved. This reduction in the amount of
                    fuel burnt was known through the post survey and analysis. Many cars were given some
                    rest as people started moving in public transport, which also helps save lot of money.
                    This will help save on car maintenance as the wear and tear is reduced. As there is a
                    reduction in the money spent on fuel and amount of fuel burnt, ultimately, there is a
                    reduction in the atmospheric pollution.
                    <br>
                    <h4>Environmental and social impacts of my project</h4>
                   
                    
                    According to the people and other sources, the project had surely made impacts on the society and
                    the local environment. This project helped people save a great deal of time and money spent on
                    travelling. Also fuel was saved. This reduction in the amount of fuel burnt was known through the
                    post survey and analysis. Many cars were given some rest as people started moving in public
                    transport, which also helps save lot of money. This will help save on car maintenance as the wear
                    and tear is reduced. As there is a reduction in the money spent on fuel and the amount of fuel burnt,
                    then ultimately, there is a reduction in the atmospheric pollution. This project is highly beneficial.
                    The project demands no funds but rather helps save lot of time and money.

                    <h4>Global issue my project relates to and how I think they have any effect
                        in addressing this issue</h4>
                    The project deals with 2 global and environmental issues and they are air pollution and depletion of
                    fossil fuels. These are one of the major, current environmental issues. What I did as a part of the
                    project include: promoting the of usage of public transport and car pooling. Car pooling is a method
                    in which helps people cut the amount spent and fuel burnt to half or more than half.
                    
                    <br><h4>If a group of students had to do the exact same study that I did ?</h4>
                    I would suggest them to take up the project on a larger scale, though it might seem to be contingent
                    wagering but there are a lot of inputs that you receive from people in the form of information
                    which will help data interpretation be more accurate. Also one should try out every opportunity to
                    spread awareness whether it comes out well or it fails.
                    
                    <br><h4>What did I learn doing this project that you’ll be able to use in other
                        situations</h4>
                    There are numerous things that I have learnt doing this project. In this project I have learnt how to
                    communicate with others about issues and patiently take people’s opinion and suggestions. I have
                    learnt how to analyze things and look at it from various sides. I have also learnt to analyze and
                    interpret data on my own and show it in different forms like charts, graphs etc. This project has also
                    taught me about the requirement of concern towards the environment and other creatures. This
                    project was not just a project for me, but was an amazing learning experience.  </p>
